**ASP.NET WebForms to MVC & jQuery:**  
Real-world tricks to make the switch

These demos were originally built for [Tulsa TechFest 2011](http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2011/Speakers/JoshuaPoehls/default.aspx).

## Synopsis

Have WebForms? Want MVC? No time to rewrite? You don't have to!

Come watch as we transform a pseudo-production application from WebForms to MVC using best practices and incremental strategies that you can use on your own projects!

Along the way we'll see:

* how MVC makes your life easier
* ways to incrementally migrate your app to MVC without a big rewrite
* common pitfalls (and solutions!) on the path from WebForms to MVC
* leveraging jQuery as a replacement for the `<asp:UpdatePanel />`, `<asp:GridView />`, and more!
* how to structure your JavaScript in a testable way

No slides. This will be a live coding event with unit tests along the way. I'll be showing off testing both controllers and JavaScript! You are definitely going to learn something in this session!
